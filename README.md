# FEC_OSL

## Introduction

This research presents an end-to-end open-set semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for fine-grained encrypted traffic classification tasks. The proposed method addresses critical issues in traditional encrypted traffic classification, including heavy reliance on labeled data, weak generalization in open-set scenarios, and insufficient classification granularity, providing more accurate technical support for network security, enabling more reliable and flexible solutions.
